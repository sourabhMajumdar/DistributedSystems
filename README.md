# Distributed Systems
Compilation of all Distributed Systems built for the course CSE 586 Distributed Systems under Prof Steve Ko

There are 3 Projects

* **Group Messenger**
  Here I build a instant messenging service that ensures FIFO and TOTAL Ordering Guarentees under failures backed by the ISIS Algorithm.
  
 * **Simple Distributed Hash Table**
  This work builds a Simple Distributed Hash Table and communicates with the CHORD protocol.
  
 * **Amazon's Dynamo DB**
  This work creates a replica of Amazon's Dynamo DB with replicated key-value storage and provides linearizability with eventual     consitency under failures
