# Amazon's Dynamo DB

If you ever wondered how Dynamo's DB  / Mongo DB is created, this repository might give you some answers

In this work we create the Amazon's Distributed Dynamo Database using 5 android devices. 

Just like Dynamo we provide linearizability and availability of your data even under consistent failures. Meaning that even if some of the phones are damaged/switched off, your data will not be lost

It is a replicated key-value store hence at present doesn't store complex RDBMS meaning we do not have multiple attributes, just 2.


This was made for the Course CSE 586 Distributed Systems
and the rest of the reference for running and installing it is here
