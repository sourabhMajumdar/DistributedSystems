# Amazon's Dynamo DB

If you ever wondered how Dynamo's DB is created, this repository might give you some answers
In this work we create the Amazon's Distributed Dynamo DB using 5 android devices. 

Just like Dynamo we provide linearizability and availability of your data even under consistent failures.
It is a replicated key-value store hence at present doesn't store complex RDBMS.
