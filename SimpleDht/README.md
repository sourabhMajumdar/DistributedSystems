# Simple Distributed Hash Table

 Here we will design a simple DHT based on Chord. 
 Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord; we do not implement finger tables and finger-based routing;
 we also do not handle node leaves/failures
 
 Apart from that it implements all the Chord Functionalities
